Hey there! The name's Josh.

- I'm actively studying Computer Science at UTS, majoring in AI and Data Analytics.
- I absolutely love to program, with my favorite language to use being Python - Writing neat code is probably the most relaxing thing in the world.
- If you'd like to contact me, add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-djordjevic-b67a2a26b/)

Coding isn't all I do though!
- I love art - 3D modelling and rendering is probably my favorite, and I followed that passion throughout highschool and ended up winning a pretty decent animation competition, scoring a cash prize for myself and my school.
- I also love team sports. I've been playing field hockey for as long as I can remember.

I'm always eager to learn, so if you'd need someone like me on your team shoot me a message over on LinkedIn and we'll sort something out :)
